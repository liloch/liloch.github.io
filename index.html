the title：When Practice Makes Imperfect
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.
“Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?”
"These are the instructions,” replied the lamplighter:“ Good morning.”
“What are the instructions?”
“The instructions are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.”
And he lighted his lamp again.
“But why have you just lighted it again?”
"These are the instructions,” replied the lamplighter:
“I do not understand,” said the little prince.
"There is nothing to understand,” said the lamplighter. “Instructions are instructions. Good
morning.”
And he put out his lamp.
Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
“I. follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the
morning and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.
“And the instructions have been changed since that time?”
“The instructions have not been changed,” said the lamplighter: "That is the tragedy! From
year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"

1. Day after day the celestial lamplighter performed his well-practiced task. For him by now it was second nature. The planet, however, like the rest of the world, kept on changing. The routine stayed fixed, while the context changed.
2.One of the most cherished myths in education or any kind of training is that in order to learn a skill one must practice it to the point of doing it without thinking. Whether I ask colleagues concerned with higher education， parents of young children, or students themselves，everyone seems to agree on this approach to what are called the basics. Whether it learning how to play baseball, drive, or teach, the advice is the same: practice the basics until they become second nature. I think this is the wrong way to start.
3. Before explaining this last statement, let me give an example of just one context for each of the skills I mentioned that might lead one to question this faith in practicing the basics.
4.As a child in summer camp l was taught to practice holding a baseball bat a particular way. The idea was to do so without thinking so that I could attend to other aspects of the game, such as the particular pitch I was trying to hit. Now, after years of lifting weights imperfectly, my right arm is stronger than my left. Should I hold the bat the same way in spite of this difference? Should everyone hold a bat the same way?
5. Because my driving skills have been overlearned, I flip my turn signal on automatically before making a turn. Now, suppose that I'm on an icy road about to make a turn, but the car is somewhat out of control. Wouldn't turning on the signal in the same old way misguide the car behind by seeming to indicate that the situation is well in hand? Would use of the flashing light be more appropriate in this context? Recently I gave a talk in New Mexico. I was driven from the airport to the hotel across a desert, without a car in sight for miles and miles. At each turn, the driver dutifully signaled.
6. Imagine overlearning the basics of driving in the United States and then taking a vacation in London, where people drive on the left side of the road. The car in front of you swerves out of control and you must react quickly. Do you slip back to old habits or avoid an accident by responding to what the current situation demands? It is interesting to consider that emergencies may often be the result of actions taken in response to previous training rather than in response to present considerations.
7.One of the "basic skills” of teachers, and all lecturers, is the ability to take a large quantity of information and present it in bite-size pieces to students. For those of us who teach, reducing and organizing information becomes second nature. How often do we, so practiced in how to present information for a lecture, continue to present a prepared lesson without noticing that the class is no longer paying attention? Presenting all the prepared content too often overtakes the goal of teaching.
8. For students，note-taking skills can be overlearned, practiced as second nature. Many of us have had the experience of turning to our notes and finding that we don't have the vaguest idea what they mean.
9.Traveling makes us particularly aware rigidities. In several Asian countries drivers drive on the left side of the road, and pedestrians on the busy sidewalks follow the same pattern as cars, staying to the right or left accordingly. The frequency with which I came close to walking into people when traveling in Asia made clear to me that even a simple exercise, such as walking on the right, if originally learned mindlessly, may be hard to change. Each time I traveled to a different country, the rules changed, and my awkwardness increased.
10. When we drill ourselves in a certain skill so that it becomes second nature, does this lead to performing the skill mindlessly? Do we set limits on ourselves by practicing to the point of overlearning? When we approach a new skill, whether as adults or children, it is, by definition, a time when we know the least about it. Does it make sense to freeze our understanding of the skill before we try it out in different contexts and, at various stages, adjust it to our own strengths and experiences? Does it make sense to stick to what we first learned when that learning occurred when we were most naive? When we first learn a skill, we necessarily attend to each individual step. If we overlearn the drill, we essentially lose sight of the individual components and we find it hard to make small adjustments.
11. Learning the basics in a rote, unthinking manner almost ensures mediocrity. At the least, it deprives learners of maximizing their own potential for more effective performance and，for enjoyment of the activity. Consider tennis. At tennis camp I was taught exactly how to hold my racket and toss the ball when serving. We were all taught the same way. When l later watched the U.S.Open, I noticed that none of the top players served the way l was taught, and, more important, each of them served slightly differently. Most of us are not taught our skills， whether academic, athletic, or artistic, by the real experts. The rules we are given to practice are based on generally accepted truths about how to perform the task and not on our individual abilities. If we mindlessly practice these skills, we are not likely to surpass our teachers. Even if we are fortunate enough to be shown how to do something by a true expert, mindless practice keeps the activity from becoming our own. If we learn the basics but do not overlearn them， we can vary them as we change or as the situation changes.
12. Perhaps the very notion of basics needs to be questioned. So-called basic skills are
normatively derived. They are usually at least partially applicable for most people some of the time. They are sometimes not useful at all for some people (e. g-, how to hold the racket for someone who is missing a finger or how to read a text for someone with dyslexia). They are not useful, however, as first learned, for everyone across all situations. If they are mindlessly overlearned, they are not likely to be varied even when variation would be advantageous. Perhaps one could say that for everyone there are certain basics, but that there is no such thing as the basics.
13. In the classroom, teaching one set of basics for everyone may appear to be easier for the teacher. There are ways, however, to foster mindful learning of basic skills in classrooms full of potential experts. The rationale for this change in approaches is based on the belief that experts at anything become expert in part by varying those same basics. The rest of us, taught not to question, take them for granted.
14. The key to this new way of teaching is based on an appreciation of both the conditional, or context-dependent, nature of the world and the value of uncertainty. Teaching skills and facts in a conditional way sets the stage for doubt and an awareness of how different situations may call for subtle differences in what we bring to them. This way of teaching imposes no special burden on teachers. Rather, it may increase their own mindfulness as it helps individual students come closer to realizing their potential.
